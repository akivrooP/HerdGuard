# 🐄 HerdGuard AI

### Smart India Hackathon 2026

**AI/ML-Based Early Warning and Decision-Support System for Subclinical Mastitis**

> **Project Type: Mostly Software**

HerdGuard is an IoT + AI early-warning system designed to identify increasing mastitis risk in dairy cattle by analysing longitudinal cow-level data.

The core of HerdGuard is a machine-learning pipeline that transforms sensor and farm data into:

**Individual Baseline → Anomaly Detection → Risk Prediction → Explainable AI → Decision Support**

IoT sensors act as the data-acquisition layer that supplies the software platform with real-world cattle and farm measurements.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Mastitis is a major challenge in dairy farming. The subclinical stage can develop before obvious clinical symptoms appear, making early identification difficult.

Traditional observation may detect the problem only after changes in milk quality, production or animal behaviour become noticeable.

HerdGuard proposes a software-driven AI system that continuously analyses cow-level measurements and identifies deviations from an individual animal's normal behaviour.

The goal is to provide an early-warning signal that can support farmers and veterinary personnel in deciding when further inspection or clinical confirmation may be appropriate.
